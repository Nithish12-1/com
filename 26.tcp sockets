AIM: To implement date and time display from client to server using TCP Sockets 
DESCRIPTION: TCP Server gets the system date and time and opens the server socket to read the client details. Client send its address to the server. Then client receives the date and time from server to display. TCP socket server client connection is opened for communication. After the date time is displayed the server client connection is closed with its respective streams to be closed. 
ALGORITHM: 
Server 1. Create a server socket and bind it to port. 2. Listen for new connection and when a connection arrives, accept it. 3. Send server‟s date and time to the client. 4. Read client‟s IP address sent by the client. 5. Display the client details. 6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the server is terminated. 7. Close all streams. 8. Close the server socket. 9. Stop. 
Client 1. Create a client socket and connect it to the server‟s port number. 2. Retrieve its own IP address using built-in function. 3. Send its address to the server. 4. Display the date & time sent by the server. 5. Close the input and output streams. 6. Close the client socket. 7. Stop.

Server: 
$ javac tcpdateserver.java
 $ java tcpdateserver Press Ctrl+C to quit 
Client System/IP address is :localhost.localdomain/127.0.0.1
 Client System/IP address is :localhost.localdomain/127.0.0.1 
Client:
$ javac tcpdateclient.java 
$ java tcpdateclient
The date/time on server is: Wed Jul 06 07:12:03 GMT 2011
 Every time when a client connects to the server, server‟s date/time will be returned to the client for synchronization.
